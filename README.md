## Development ##

[Enabling debug mode](https://codex.wordpress.org/Debugging_in_WordPress) in your `wp-config.php` file is recommended during development to help catch warnings and bugs.

### Requirements ###
* node v16+
* gulp-cli

### Instructions ###
1. Clone the UCF-Video-VTT repo into your local development environment, within your WordPress installation's `plugins/` directory: `git clone https://github.com/UCF/UCF-Video-VTT.git`
2. `cd` into the new UCF-Video-VTT directory, and run `npm install` to install required packages for development into `node_modules/` within the repo
3. Optional: If you'd like to enable [BrowserSync](https://browsersync.io) for local development, or make other changes to this project's default gulp configuration, copy `gulp-config.template.json`, make any desired changes, and save as `gulp-config.json`.

    To enable BrowserSync, set `sync` to `true` and assign `syncTarget` the base URL of a site on your local WordPress instance that will use this plugin, such as `http://localhost/wordpress/my-site/`.  Your `syncTarget` value will vary depending on your local host setup.

    The full list of modifiable config values can be viewed in `gulpfile.js` (see `config` variable).
3. Run `gulp default` to process front-end assets.
4. If you haven't already done so, create a new WordPress site on your development environment to test this plugin against, and [install and activate all plugin dependencies](https://github.com/UCF/UCF-Video-VTT/wiki/Installation#installation-requirements).
5. Activate this plugin on your development WordPress site.
